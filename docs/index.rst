========

NordPass is a secure password manager designed to help users store and manage their passwords, credit card information, and other sensitive data. Developed by the team behind NordVPN, NordPass uses advanced encryption technologies to ensure that all stored information is protected. With its user-friendly interface, NordPass allows users to easily create and autofill strong passwords, generate secure passwords for each account, and store other critical information like secure notes and personal details. It also offers cross-platform compatibility, ensuring access to your data from any device, including Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.

Key Features
------------
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted locally on the user's device before it is uploaded to the NordPass cloud, ensuring that only the user has access to their data.
- **Password Generator**: NordPass includes a built-in password generator, allowing users to create strong, random passwords for better security.
- **Cross-Platform Syncing**: NordPass seamlessly syncs across all your devices, ensuring that your passwords are always accessible when needed.
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: NordPass employs a zero-knowledge policy, meaning that even NordPass itself cannot access your stored data.
